	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p style="margin:0px 200px 20px 200px">Hello my name is Andrew DePero. 
	I am a student at Miami University majoring in Computer Science. 
	My hometown is Wadsworth, OH which is near Cleveland. Since an early age, I have been interested in algorithms and computing. 
	I am dedicated to exploring all knowledge and experiences that will enable me to become the best programmer I can be. 
	I have a problem solving mindset, and my classes and experiences attribute to my high work ethic. 
	I put only my best effort forth, and hope to leave a lasting impact on the field of technology and computing.</p>
	<p>This website is designed to serve as a profile of my projects and experiences while I attend Miami.</p>
