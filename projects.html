	<h2>Polygon Drawer</h2>
	<p>A java program that creates a GUI that allows a user to click on a resizable canvas and draws a polygon 
	with points specified by the user’s clicks. By right clicking, the user can complete the polygon and it is 
	either hollow using a normal right click, or filled in by holding shift and right clicking. Then the user can start a new one in a new color. 
	There is also a saving functionality that saves the current canvas as a binary file using a data output stream and a file output stream, 
	which can be loaded in with another button and continued to be worked on.</p>
